#Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset
#Welcome to your first (required) programming assignment! You will build a logistic regression classifier to recognize cats. This assignment will step you through how to do this with a Neural Network mindset, and so will also hone your intuitions about deep learning.

#Instructions:

#Do not use loops (for/while) in your code, unless the instructions explicitly ask you to do so.
#You will learn to:

#Build the general architecture of a learning algorithm, including:
#Initializing parameters
#Calculating the cost function and its gradient
#Using an optimization algorithm (gradient descent)
#Gather all three functions above into a main model function, in the right order.

#Problem Statement: You are given a dataset ("data.h5") containing:

#- a training set of m_train images labeled as cat (y=1) or non-cat (y=0)
#- a test set of m_test images labeled as cat or non-cat
#- each image is of shape (num_px, num_px, 3) where 3 is for the 3 channels (RGB). Thus, each image is square (height = num_px) and (width = num_px).
#You will build a simple image-recognition algorithm that can correctly classify pictures as cat or non-cat.

#One common preprocessing step in machine learning is to center and 
#standardize your dataset, meaning that you substract the mean of 
#the whole numpy array from each example, and then divide each 
#example by the standard deviation of the whole numpy array. 
#But for picture datasets, it is simpler and more convenient and 
#works almost as well to just divide every row of the dataset by 
#255 (the maximum value of a pixel channel).
